# 42-abudhabi
In line with the UAE-France strategic partnership and as part of the Ghadan 21 accelerator program, Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) has partnered with 42 to launch 42 Abu Dhabi, establishing the first school of its kind in the GCC.

By making coding education accessible to people from all walks of life, the school will contribute to Abu Dhabiâ€™s vision for a tech-enabled future, where Abu Dhabi plays a prominent role in solving global challenges.
